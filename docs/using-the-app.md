## ⚙️ Setting Flight Parameters

Fine-tune your settings:

| Parameter | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Altitude | Height of flight grid |
| Speed | Drone travel speed |
| Overlap | Image overlap for stitching |

## ✈️ Flight Parameters

Understanding each setting helps you produce better imagery. OpenFlightPlan pulls defaults from `drone_specs.py` when you choose your drone model.

### Altitude
- Determines ground resolution and coverage area.
- Stay within your drone's limits (max 120 m for DJI models).
- Higher altitude = fewer images but lower detail.

### Speed
- How fast the drone travels along the path.
- Constrained by your drone's capability (up to 21 m/s for a Mavic 3 Pro).
- Slower speeds allow longer exposure times and better overlap.

### Front Overlap
- Percentage each image overlaps the previous one along the flight direction.
- Typical orthomosaics use **70%+**.

### Sidelap
- Overlap between adjacent flight lines.
- Aim for **60–70%** for mapping to avoid gaps.

### Interval
- Time between photo triggers.
- Minimum of **0.5 s** based on DJI specs.

### FOV
- Camera field of view in degrees (about **82°** on most DJI models).
- A wider FOV covers more ground but increases distortion near edges.

### Orthomosaic Tips
- Fly **nadir** (camera pointing straight down).
- Use higher overlap and sidelap for photogrammetry.
- Moderate altitude (60–100 m) balances detail and coverage.

### Oblique Mission Tips
- Tilt the camera and fly concentric circles for 3D models.
- Use several layers at different altitudes.
- Reduce speed to maintain blur‑free images.
